# MeUni
MeUni is a mobile-based application where customers will meet new friends based on their hobbies and interests. Users can also meet based on similar school schedules or interest in school events/organization, and form study groups. Our target customers are university students who have a hard time looking for friends to do particular hobbies or activities with, or studying with others in the same classes. The goal of our product is to help them get connected with other previously-unknown fellow students who would participate in the activities. For example, let’s say a student wants to play a golf game with someone, but he or she doesn’t know anyone who would be interested in playing golf. Then he or she can make a post saying that he or she is looking for someone to play a golf game with. Given that this product is geared towards college students, it will incorporate some aspects of their academics. Users may input their class schedules to connect to other users with similar schedules, or even find other students in the same class. This way students may form study groups and organize meetings through MeUni.

Our goal is to provide the following features:
- Posting events: To announce and invite people over to the events.
- Saving events:
   - A List: Customers can create a list of possible events he/she would attend.
- User profiles: Our app will require 1-2 profile pictures, name, or age. 
- University account verification: This app is for college students only, and thus the verification process, just like the one UW currently has, is essential.
- Schedule Inputter: our users will be able to input in their schedules on our app, possibly in 30-minutes intervals
- Message Board for UW Organizations to advertise events, with RSVP functionality
- Searching for users with filters. Possible filters include
  - Year (freshman, sophomore, etc.)
  - Major/Minor(s)
  - Similar Classes
  - Pronouns
  - Interests
  - Registered Classes 
- Chat/Messaging feature where users can invite users/friends (they would find users using the search query feature detailed above)

That said, we hope to implement the following features if time permits:
- Ability to blocking certain users from having communication or access to one’s profiles
- Implementing a “Share my Location” feature via usage of location sharing APIs.
- Implementation of Payment for Event Ticket Purchases within Application

The repo is setup as such:
- top level weekly report directory has our progress, updates, and issues for eah week as we are developing the application
