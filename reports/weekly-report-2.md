## Thevina

### Previous Week's Goals

- begin working on tutorials for Codename One, Firebase, and SQL
- work with team to setup GitHub Repo and Issues Board
- discuss with team on architecture design, primarily for the backend mobile and server aspect and contribute towards drafting our proposal for the Architecture and Design Milestone Report
- Create team Trello Board
- work with team to develop backend API design and communication between mobile and back-end servers
- work to oversee and help with application UI design

### Progress and Issues

- worked on identifying additional project risks and outlines impact, probability, evidence, steps to reduce impact, and mitigation strategies for each risk
- worked to develop software design and architecture framework for project and finalize programming tools we will be using
- completed tutorials to be familiarized with Flutter and Dart

### Plans and Goals

- finalize API Design for Backend Implementation as outlined by milestone 23 so that backend and frontend can run independently
- work with front end team members to create initial figma prototype of application

## Apolo

### Previous Week's Goals

- Complete software setup of Firebase, Codename One
- Help plan software architecture and design from the perspective of the server-side backend
- Plan out database at a high level
- Brainstorm front-end architeture and anything else in which the team may need assistance

### Progress and Issues

- Assisted in designing backend architecture and design
- Finalized user journeys, flow between pages
- Began Figma UI illustations

### Plans and Goals

- Learn the Flutter and Firebase interface and operations through tutorials and experimentation
- Assist Fei in finalizing UI design and completing UI Illustrations in Figma
- Assist with completing API design

## Fei

### Previous Week's Goals

- work on architecture milestones with the group
- Finished final UI for the app
- Find other tools for frontend besides Figma
- work with the team to develop communication between front-end and back-end servers
- Setting up all the software and communication tools we are going to use in this project

### Progress and Issues

- Architecture milestone complete
- Still not yet finished the final UI design due to time conflicts.
- no other tool was find to use beside Figma(staying only with figma)
- Not yet started the back-end implementation.
- 80% done with setting up all the software and communication tool

### Plans and Goals

- Finished the final UI by Friday
- Finished setting up all the software and communication tools by Tuesday.
- Start to connect UI to the backend.
- potentially add some more feature for future implementation.

## Jintae

### Previous Week's Goals

- As I mentioned above, the backend side of our project is what I am responsible for. Thus it is essential to have a solid understanding of how each tool can serve our particular needs. There are a lot of learning resources on the Internet, like YouTube or FreeCodeCamp, where without any charge I can learn how to use these tools.
- Also, I will set up the working environment on my laptop as Codename One and Flutter seem to require to do so. This means I will clean up my laptop memory to enable the installation and download the software.

### Progress and Issues

- Along with the team, I wrote the "Architecture and Design Overview" document. In the previous document, there were preexisting three major risks, and I wrote the given questions on top of them. Moreover, I provided an alternative to the API technology we are planning to use. By writing that part, I learned a new technology for an API design which is GraphQL, although RESTful API is more broadly used.
There was a challenge along the way. It was difficult to come up with the "plan for detecting problem" sections for each major risk. So, I had to discuss with the teammates to brainstorm to generate new ideas.

### Plans and Goals

- I have to review and learn the backend technologies we will employ. Also, I have to finalize the API design for the backend implementation.
