# Team Report

## Progress and Issues

### Progress

- Determined team goals, practices, and collaboration techniques
- furthered the initial project idea to be more extensive and tailored towards our target user group
- Work to write up the initial draft of our project proposal collectively
- Explored different software toolset via online tutorials
- Assigned primary and secondary team roles and responsibilities
- Finalized weekly team meetings times/locations for daily standup, biweekly retros, and dedicated group work time

### Issues

- The initial app concept did not have sufficient features and was not dsitinctive from other social media and communication platforms that already exist (as our mentor Saket had pointed out to us). We work to bring more clarity on the intial goal of our application and determined additional features to integrate and develop
- Still deciding between two toolsets for which one suits the project better. As we detail the arcitecture and experiment with the new language (Dart) and UI creation, we will be able to see which is reasonable given the short time frame

## Plans and Goals

- Install software tools (Everyone)
- Set up GitHub Repo and Version Control (Everyone)
- Start exploring and learning the toolset we intend to use (Everyone)

## Meeting Agenda

1. Brief on our efforts for the past week
2. Walkthrough idea of our architecture
3. Walkthrough  must have and stretch goal features
    - get any feedback on feature designs
4. walkthrough proposed project milestone schedule
    - discuss any concerns, does timeline goals seem feasible
5. Team Collaboration Overview

## Apolo

### Progress and Issues

- Contributed to Requirements doc with updated project description including new features, detailing a use case and milestone brainstorming
- Helped to choose some of the software tools
- Installation of Flutter, tested demo project
- Ran into problems creating a use case distinct from the others, since app features were too simple before

### Plans and Goals

- Complete software setup of Firebase, Codename One
- Help plan software architeture and design from the perspective of the server-side backend
  - Plan out database at a high level
  - Brainstorm front-end architeture and anything else in which the team may need assistance

## Fei

### Progress and Issues

- Finishing up a final vision of UI
- discuss the software tools we going to use for the project, mainly front-end
- no major Issues were present in this week's report.

### Plans and Goals

- work on architecture milestones with the group
- Finished final UI for the app
- Find other tools for frontend besides Figma
- work with the team to develop communication between front-end and back-end servers
- Setting up all the software and communication tools we are going to use in this project

## Jintae

### Progress and Issues

- When writing the project document with the team members, I primarily focused on the "Product description" section. In this section, out of the basic outlines I wrote for the previous assignment, I introduced how our application would serve our potential customers.
- Also, as a project participant focusing on the backend, I discussed what technological tools to use with the team members. As a result, I learned new developer tools I hadn't heard of before, such as Codename One, Flutter, and Dart. However, our team also didn't have previous hands-on experience with those tools, so I struggled to understand what each tool was supposed to do (as I had no one to discuss with). So, I couldn't proceed with writing more about the specific usage of those tools.

### Plans and Goals

- As I mentioned above, the backend side of our project is what I am responsible for. Thus it is essential to have a solid understanding of how each tool can serve our particular needs. There are a lot of learning resources on the Internet, like YouTube or FreeCodeCamp, where without any charge I can learn how to use these tools.
- Also, I will set up the working environment on my laptop as Codename One and Flutter seem to require to do so. This means I will clean up my laptop memory to enable the installation and download the software.
