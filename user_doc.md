# What is MeUni?
MeUni is a mobile platform where UW students can meet new friends based on their hobbies and interests. Users can also meet based on similar school schedules or interest in school events/organization, and form study groups. It is avaliable for Android and iOS systems. MeUni serves to make it easy to organize small meetups with other students who share the same interests and view events all throuought campus, fostering new connections.

# How to Install MeUni
For the version v1.0, MeUni is installable at Android devices through the APK file in the assets section of the [v1.0]() release page. The system will likely give you warnings saying the file is unsafe upon download, and block the app upon installation, since we are not verified developers on the Play Store. You may bypass this warning by tapping "More Details", then "Install Anyway" when opening the .apk file.

# How to Run MeUni
Once installed, MeUni appears on the home screen of your smartphone. Click on the app, and it starts to run.

# Using MeUni
Before enjoying our app, you need to create an account that is bound to your school's NetID. Once created, you are in! Now, there are several ways you can make use of our app, depending on your needs:

## Join an event
- You can join already existing events others have already posted. Click the "join" button on an event you'd like to participate in, and that's it. Check the time and location and meet your new mates there!

## Create your own event
- You can create your events to invite other people over. To do this, you can click on the "Add an Event" button at the bottom of your screen. After that, choose a desirable event description, location, dates, start time, and end time. Once done, wait for people to join your event and have fun!

## View UW organized events
- You can see larger events set up by RSOs and other organizations across UW in the **Uni-ing** tab. You may use the search bar to narrow down a particular type of event or filter based on a certain date/time range. For these events, a link will be provided to a payment or RSVP page with more information.

## Study groups
- Another feature of MeUni other than being involved in events is that you can form or join a study group that has your classmates from a particular course. To do so, click on the "Create a study group" or "Join a study group" buttons.
