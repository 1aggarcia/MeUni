# What is MeUni?
MeUni is a mobile platform where UW students can meet new friends based on their hobbies and interests. Users can also meet based on similar school schedules or interest in school events/organization, and form study groups. It is avaliable for Android and iOS systems. MeUni serves to make it easy to organize small meetups with other students who share the same interests and view events all throuought campus, fostering new connections.

# How to Install MeUni
We expect MeUni to be installable on at least Android devices through an APK file. A link to download will be provided in the project's README file. Users download the file and open it to install. Google Play charges a one time $25 fee to publish apps and the App Store a $99 annual fee, but supplying APKs through a third-party is free.

# How to Run MeUni
Once installed, MeUni appears on the home screen of your smartphone. Click on the app, and it starts to run.

# Using MeUni
Before enjoying our app, you need to create an account that is bound to your school's NetID. Once created, you are in! Now, there are several ways you can make use of our app, depending on your needs:

## Join an event
- You can join already existing events others have already posted. Click the "join" button on an event you'd like to participate in, and that's it. Check the time and location and meet your new mates there!

## Create your own event
- You can create your events to invite other people over. To do this, you can click on the "Add an Event" button at the bottom of your screen. After that, choose a desirable event description, location, dates, start time, and end time. Once done, wait for people to join your event and have fun!

## View UW organized events
- You can see larger events set up by RSOs and other organizations across UW in the **Uni-ing** tab. You may use the search bar to narrow down a particular type of event or filter based on a certain date/time range. For these events, a link will be provided to a payment or RSVP page with more information.

## Study groups
- Another feature of MeUni other than being involved in events is that you can form or join a study group that has your classmates from a particular course. To do so, click on the "Create a study group" or "Join a study group" buttons.

    - API to get events retreives data from the database but does not provide the correct type; Data is unusable
